                Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) are the primary champions for human rights in our world today.
                They are, however, hamstrung by their funders and the whims of the sovereign nation-states
                who allow NGOs to operate within their jurisdictions (borders).
                The United Nations has repeatedly made it clear that avoiding angering some of its larger members is more important than standing up for human rights globally.
